When searching for job vacancies, I often see Sketch is in the 'expected skills' part. As a loyal Windows user (although I really struggled between Mac Pro and Thinkpad X1 Carbon three months ago), I have never tried it. Isn't it unfair to simply put 'Sketch' here for a non-Mac user? Didn't they know there are many substitutes such as AI or PS? Then I become curious about the functions of Sketch, wondering if AI (Adobe Illustrator, not Artificial Intelligence, after all the latter is so hot these years...) can replace it, as I think I am quite familiar with AI. 

I searched the keywords of Sketch and AI. Surprisingly, there are many discussions about the comparison between Sketch and PS, instead of Sketch and AI. It is rather interesting.
