Questionnaires are a common method to collect opinions from people, and it is often applied in the user research or evaluation in UX projects. However, sometimes we may feel we could not gain any insight from the responses, or we doubt if the results are reliable. What happens here? We might not identify the reasons unless we dig into the questionnaire as a research method. Understand this method, then could we make full use of it.

# Quantitative method to collect qualitative data
Surveys and questionnaires are used to gather information about your users, their attitudes and behaviors [1]. This method is attitudinal, which means it collects what people say, rather than what people do. It can be applied in any context of use, and requires low cost. It performs well when trying to understand users from a general perspective. Questions are often designed to be “quantitative”, using scales and ratings. 

After data collection, we need to identify important themes merged in these qualitative data. From the responses of surveys, we could group our observations based on common themes. If the number of participants is quite large, the number of instances could also be recorded aside with the piece of observation. By this we could identify the prevalence or frequency of a specific theme or situation.
