Building a good persona is am important step in User Experience Design, and we often hear people saying “do not ever create a elastic user”. I always smile when I hear this vivid adjective, and remind myself to keep this piece of advice in mind. However, it was not until recent job-hunting activities that I realise: I am not elastic either, as a job-hunter.

This article takes more than 2 months to complete, and I am not satisfied with it. Maybe it will be modified one year later, or see you next ten years :-)

# The confusion of being elastic

The “elastic user” is a pitfall that we should avoid when building personas. It means the abstract images of users are bent and stretched to  fit different types of target users [1], which creates an illusion that the product meets users’ goals, while actually the product does not satisfy anyone.  The danger of having elastic users lies in the imprecision of the persona. For a product, it might be useful for various types of roles, but the roles do not share the same needs. Some of their needs overlap, while some conflicts. An imprecise description of the persona could ruin the design of a product, letting designers drunk in a fake success of meeting the goal of “users”.

Being elastic in job hunting means trying to fit the needs for all the companies that recruit a UX designer. Sounds reasonable, since the requirements for this position are similar to each other. However, the differences between industries can be huge, and thus the preferred knowledge, skills and abilities vary a lot, although big words such as “passionate”“insightful” can often be found in the job descriptions. As a job hunter, what will “being elastic” bring to me?

Again, an elastic job hunter does not have a clear image. Thanks to various programmes/tutorials about UX design, I have learned and practiced from user research to visual design. In the portfolio, I present projects from how the topic was chosen to the final visual works. The comprehensive way of presentation brings some drawbacks though. To the recruiters, my portfolio might seem to lack highlights, or at least lack what they would like to see. I intended to present an image that I have many abilities, and I could explain what this page presents if you ask me. The recruiters, on the other hand, would like to see the prototypes or visual design in detail. 

I used to think a complete project could show my overall abilities, and sacrificed the granularity of each part to control the number of pages. This strategy might be wrong. It makes recruiters feel difficult grasping my traits, moreover, it disguises the core problem, that still I do not have a clear description of myself. In other words, I do not have a clear persona for job hunting.

 

# The value of a “persona” for myself

If one has ever built a persona for target users, s/he would understand the difficulty of establishing a ‘precise’ persona. From piles of raw data, we can never be sure whether the persona we build is ever close to the truth, or whether there is ever truth. But the sense of building a persona could at least drives us to investigate the data, and try to model one’s attitudes, behaviour and aims. 

For me, that is the value of a persona for myself. It drives me to observe myself, to be aware of my attitudes, behaviour and aims. Surprisingly (or not), we do not really know ourselves. Facing with questions such as ‘what’s your strengths and weakness?’, we might feel blank if we did not reflect on this question before. Even for the most basic self-introduction, we might also feel unsatisfied. How to define myself? How can a person be defined in one minute? What aspects shall I mention when introducing myself?

A person is never just the one described in a self-introduction, yet it is the most straight way for others to know this person. With a specific persona on a specific occasion, we are able to communicate ‘who I am’ to the listener efficiently. In other words, we could choose aspects that are more related to the situation, in order to let others know us better. It is pragmatic, and often works better than a comprehensive but scattered description.

# Methods to build and test my persona



There are many articles about X ways to know yourself on Psychological related websites. I do not want to simply repeat them, so let me try to explore the methods from the perspective of building a persona: collect information, analyse data, and then come to a definition. I will set the aim as a persona for job hunting interviews.

## Collect information

There are two kinds of information: structured/semi-structured data and unstructured data. Unstructured data is more common, and is more difficult to analyse. I prefer to use tools to generate semi-structured data about myself.

A notebook (either digital or physical) is a good tool to collect data. Use some frames to organise your past and reflect on it. I recently come to a ‘[yearning octopus](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html)’ framework from Tim Urban, which I found useful. To simply put it, you will explore yourself in five aspects:

* Personal
* Lifestyle
* Practical
* Moral
* Social

Have an interview with yourself, and you will collect rich information that is beyond your expectation. Do not hurry analysing or judging anything, simply put down whatever you come up with.

Some evaluation tools are often applied to test people’s characteristics or personalities, such as Big Five Structure, MBTI, Holland Codes career tests, DISC and HBDI. These tests reflect your recent behavioural tendencies to some degree, and can work as a reference or inspiration.

Unstructured data might be collected in everyday life. Use a journal to collect anything you feel meaningful. What makes you angry? Why you feel bored in this task? These records may yield a lively narrative of your mind. You could also consciously try new things to activate your sense to know yourself.

Collecting comments from people around you is also a good method. In daily life, people around you may lack a way to describe how they think about you. If you actively ask them, they must be happy to say something. These subjective impressions from others is also a valuable source of data. 

 ## Analyse data and build your persona

If you take some existing tests, usually an analysis report will be generated automatically. For other methods to collect information, you may have piles of raw materials. Read through them, find similarities and tendencies, establish connections, and achieve insights about yourself.

It would be better if you analyse data of different forms and from different sources, so that the emerging themes are more reliable. The process will also enable you to link your traits with your behaviours, which is a good example to mention in a job interview.

Finally, you are ready to create a persona for yourself. With different aims, the persona could (must) include different facets. Each characteristic you choose to include in the persona is strongly evidence-supported, and therefore you are more confident when being asked ‘Why do you think you are suitable for this position’.



Self-image is never still or simple. It is so complex that we can never form a really accurate narrative. But we can still benefit from the process to approach the truth of ourselves. It can guide us to make a choice, and more importantly, the process enables us to look deeper into ourselves.
