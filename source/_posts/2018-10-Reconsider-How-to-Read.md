Maybe it's time to reconsider how to read. I was so confident in my reading abilities that I had never doubted if I was reading in the 'right' way. In IELTS and JLPT, my reading score is always close to full marks. But being able to understand the content of articles fast and right does not necessarily mean reading in the right way. Apparently, in daily life, it is nearly impossible to spend a whole part of time reading something specially designed for you to answer specific questions. Reading is much more complex than that.

# How I read in the past
My parents often praised me, commenting me as a girl that loves reading. I was willing to accept that image, and pretended to read 'hard'. I still remember the scene that I held a heavy _Don Quixote_ when my relatives were watching TV and chatting during Spring Festival when I was about 12 years old, and my consciousness floated between the lunatic knight and people's words such as 'How could she focus on her book! What an arduous girl!' Actually, now I can recall nothing about that story except for the image of a knight and windmills, and I even did not finish reading the whole book.

Before high school, my reading habit is simply about reading itself, no extension from the books. My memory of what I read just faded away with my childhood, leaving nothing in my mind. What a pity. Although sometimes there were some homework asking you to write something about what you read, I believe I did not think much about that stuff.

The Chinese teachers in my high school enlighted us to develop the habit of making reading notes, as well as recording our comments and thoughts after finishing a book, which is of great benefit to me. I became a big fan of making excerpts, and this habit continues for a long time. Even now when I meet some good sentences, I will record it in my OneNote. However, for the 'comments' I wrote, they are not very satisfying. Little thoughts can be found in my articles; usually they are some repitition (or paraphrase) of the original content from the book plus several lyrical sentences. I have no critical comments or deeper thoughts extending from the original work. Although there seems to be some thought-provoking sentences, actually I did not think  a lot about them: they can contain rich meanings, and thus they have no meaning at all.

What makes my articles not 'deep' enough when I intended to write something 'deep'? Perhaps it is the lack of logic. My thoughts fly randomly around my feelings about a book, and I just let them flow freely, therefore the composed article looks casual and loose. It is fine in a sense, but it can be better. Writing a reaction to a book is an ideal way to reflect on the content and relate them to one's life experience, and thus the process of combing one's thoughts can help clarification and then application of them. I shall not waste this chance.

After entering university, I did not spend much time reading, which is a shame. In the end of the four years, I finally picked up reading again, and this time I started to write e-notes when reading a book. I began to use bullets too. A great step forward. But soon I found something is wrong.

# There is something wrong
The master programme has progressed for a month, and piles of reading materials can be found. The lecturer emphasized that the aim is to let us learn how to read, since it is impossible to read each material carefully. We only have 24 hours a day. Our considerate lecturer also assigned 'essential', 'recommended' and 'optional' to each material.

Here is how I realised there is something wrong with my reading. I opened a pdf file of a book marked as 'essential', and the length of the referred chapter is more than 50 pages. I opened OneNote to take some notes so that the effort to read this book would not go in vain. Then I started to read through pages after pages... wait, why my notes look like the subtitles of each section? And I am sure when I read these notes a week later nothing can be recalled. Ah, it came to me that this book is kind of like a tool box. So the correct usage is to refer to it when necessary. No need to take notes. More importantly, there is no need to read every sentence carefully! Do not be afraid that you might miss anything interesting or essential. If the topic sentence cannot catch your attention, the whole paragraph might mean little to you. 

Being brave enough to skip when reading, I read the materials much faster. For some of them I took useful notes. Several weeks later, another problem arises: I seldom use the knowlege in these books when conducting projects. What I use is still my past experience, along with scattered 'principles' and 'patterns', while I pursue for a holistic view when analysing and solving a problem. There is a huge gap between what I expect and what I experience.

In order to obtain the ability to think logically and to have a systematic view, I find some more books to read. With so many books to read, I seem to get lost again. For most of these books, a lot of time and effort is needed to comprehend the content. How could I manage it in limited time?

# Make a new plan
When a problem arises, it is the high time for humans to present their wisdom. Generally, I have three problems about reading: difficult to manage time for many reading materials; lack the consiousness of skimming; can hardly put theory into practice. Let me tackle them one by one.

## Time management for reading
I build two reading systems in my mind. The first is major-related reading materials, which are composed mainly of textbooks and papers. One feature of these materials is clear structure. Therefore, I only need to find the part I am interested in to read, instead of reading every sentence carefully. The main purpose of reading these materials is to gain a comprehensive understanding of this field, and in addition one could find some interesting details to take down. I allocate one hour in the morning to read the textbooks and one hour after class to read the papers. 

The second reading system is for self-improvement materials. In terms of area, I have interest in Logic Thinking, User Experience Design and Systems Theory recently. I am consistently interested in reading philosophical and literary works. Besides, I also want to learn about economics and history, which I know little about.  For the areas I am currently interested in, I choose one book(which is certainly demanding) for each to read carefully and take notes, either in the morning or in the evening. For the books that are easy to read, I will just read through them quickly and record the things I feel interesting. For others, finding some time during weekend would be fine.

Time is valuable. I used to find the time in the morning is so short, while during the long night I often lack the concentration to read one book after another. Therefore I decided to rearrange my daily routine, adjusting my getting-bed time to 22:40 and waking time to 06:40. For the past two days, I think it works well. Let me experience it longer.

## Rythm of reading
When eating curry rice, I tend to devour it very quickly. In comparison, I never eat up a small piece of cake within several minutes. I will 'taste' it as slow as possible. Reading also has such differences in terms of 'rythm'. I am not saying any kind of books is like curry rice or cake, but for some books it does not require careful reading(although it may hurt the authors). Within a book there might also be some parts that can be scanned very quickly.

For major-related reading materials, we have established a (kind of fragile) knowledge system with the help from lecturers, therefore what I need to do is to find the 'uncertain' parts and make it solid. When reading something, try to be a 'sampler', which means scanning first and then choosing a specific part to focus on. The goal is to deepen something that we have already learned and to solidify our existing knowledge system (hopefully).

For other reading materials, a general principle is to clarify the structure first, which helps me to decide a suitable reading strategy and form an initial vague 'system' of what will be presented. For a delicious book, it is worthwhile to 'chew' the content slowly again and again. For a book which is not that to my taste, I will just skim over some parts.

To find a comfortable rythm for reading a book is not so easy, to be honest. We have the tendency to keep exploiting until we feel the information does not have much value. It is consistent with the [information foraging theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_foraging). Therefore, make an attempt to overcome our nature! It makes sense.

## Application is always not easy
Reading is a process that can provide others' experience. Facing the world full of chaos, we sometimes rely on the 'secondary experience' to help us understand what is happening in a deeper way. In many times, however, what we have read just slip away from our mind, as if we have never read them. It is a pity. On one hand, it is unrealistic to see an immediate effect after finishing a book; on the other hand, we hope the things gained from books can be useful to one's own life. 

Applying a theory is always not that simple, let alone the experience described in a book. But it is worthy of being considered. I temperarily have three ideas regarding the application of knowledge in a book. (Here, lirarary work might be ruled out for a moment)

### Idea 1: Have A Goal
Having a goal enables me to stay focused on what is important. A book contains abundant information, which means it can be interpreted in various ways. If I let my mind flow with the author, maybe I will end up remembering nothing.  A goal in mind is like an antenna: once you glance at some specific words that are related to your goal, the antenna will remind you to notice them. For example, if I am interested in how to establish user requirements when designing a product, I will pay more attention to the 'Requirements' part in _About Face 4.0_. With a goal in mind, I also feel clearer for the notes I take down because it allows a top-down strategy which helps build a system in my mind.

### Idea 2: Be Critical
There is nothing more useful than being critical that can help you understand what you are reading and build 'connections' with your existing knowledge and experience. Keep asking questions, keep imagining, keep thinking. I am not used to critical thinking, though, where I need to put more effort. In other words, I am still too lazy a person to think during reading. 

### Idea 3: Write it Down
Output forces you to organize what you have read and build new connections. For a lazy person like me, perhaps writing something after finishing a book is the best way to push me to think. I am still a freshman in terms of outputing, so I could not say more. Let me try for several months, and then I might update the notes here!

# Ending
I finished this article in a week, which is much longer than I thought. During this week, I read _About Face 4.0_ and _General System Theory_. A system has not been established in my mind, which means there is still a long way to go in terms of learning how to read. Reading is enjoyable when it is about 'stories', while the knowledge-intensed stuff can be hard to absorb. Both are worth reading, but different strategies should be applied. And, I think it is better to combine both in daily reading habit, otherwise reading may become a miserable thing to do :P
