Since visually impaired people have limited ability to explore museum collections by sight, other sensory modalities are explored in museums, especially the sense of touch. High-quality tactile paintings could be produced quickly using rapid prototyping machines, which can be a good learning tool in museums or galleries [1]. 3D works of art such as statues can also be reproduced into virtual 3D copies, and visually impaired people can touch them using devices [5]. The collections could even be accessed remotely, with the aid of haptic modality and robotic telepresence [6]. Many touch tours have been organised by museums, some of which are designed as an additional feature [9], and some involve visually impaired people in the design phase [2]. Touching is suggested to provide “unforgettable experience” in a museum [6], however, it is also argued that touch might not be more accessible than vision [4][7]. 

The representation form of collections seems not to be an essential factor of museum visit experience; interaction with people might matter more. Handa et al. [8] report accessibility to exhibitions and collections as well as staff assistance are the priority needs selected by Japanese visually impaired visitors, and the quality of service is more important than special facilities. Being able to touch does not guarantee a good museum experience. It is often the interaction between visually impaired visitors and other visitors or staff that enriches the visit experience in a museum. Social interaction could bring a sense of inclusion [3][10], while visually impaired visitors tend to have low expectations of the management and staff of museums [10].
