With the topic "weaving threads", what can we design to take advantage of technology within a community so that strengthen the connection between people? After exploration in three months, our group presented the design solution of an interactive system: Codudo.

Codudo aims at encouraging international students to express themselves through co-doodling, in order to enhance the sense of belonging. The system is composed of three parts: doodle booth, mobile App and presentation screen. Users will add their own doodle to the digital canvas in the doodle booth; they could interact with other users in the App; the work created collaborately by everyone would be shown in the presentation screen, which is ideally located in a public place in the community.

How did we narrow the problem from an abstract concept to "senses of belonging", and how did we come up with the solution of co-doodling? Based on our progress, I will explain it in X parts.
