It is a rare chance to design something for the blind, and I did not predict that I would have that chance to do so. In the second mini project for the course Interaction Design, I was randomly assigned with the task of desiging a survey machine to collect opinions about walking experience through the city from the blind or visually impaired people. 

Is sounds a challenging task.
