As a loyal Windows user (although I really struggled between Mac Pro and Thinkpad X1 Carbon three months ago), I have never tried it. Isn’t it unfair to simply put ‘Sketch’ here for a non-Mac user? Didn’t they know there are many substitutes such as AI or PS? Then I become curious about the functions of Sketch, wondering if AI (Adobe Illustrator, not Artificial Intelligence, after all the latter is so hot these years…) can replace it, as I think I am quite familiar with AI. </p>\n<p>I searched the keywords of Sketch and AI.
