The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was going to use a new dashboard so that staff could access information easily, in order to improve the overall performance of ICU. Our group was assigned to refine the prototype of the dashboard from the perspective of clinical targets.</p>\n<h1 id=\"My-proposal\">My proposal<a href=\"post/2019-05-Improvement-of-ICU-dashboard#My-proposal\"></a></h1><p>I proposed to combine information in Metrics widgets into the floor plan so that staff could make sense of the metrics in a more intuitive way. Icons with colours and initials are used to make different metrics more identifiable.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Understanding-the-problems-and-the-users\">Understanding the problems and the users<a href=\"post/2019-05-Improvement-of-ICU-dashboard#Understanding-the-problems-and-the-users\"></a></h1><h2 id=\"Aim-of-this-project\">Aim of this project<a href=\"post/2019-05-Improvement-of-ICU-dashboard#Aim-of-this-project\"></a></h2><ul>\n<li>Understand user goals, practices, needs</li>\n<li>Identify issues of current dashboard prototype</li>\n<li>Propose future design possibilities</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"What-the-current-dashboard-could-do\">What the current dashboard could do<a href=\"post/2019-05-Improvement-of-ICU-dashboard#What-the-current-dashboard-could-do\"></a></h2><blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Displays a real-time overview of some unit and clinical data. The dashboard has 16 different metrics of three themes (flow/floor metrics, medication safety metrics, and clinical target metrics).</li>\n<li>Has a drill-down function whereby a user can see this unit-level data and then identify where intervention is needed</li>\n<li>Automatically collects and displays retrospective data for audit/quality improvement</li>\n<li>Provides some education/training interventions around the various metrics</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"Interview\">Interview<a href=\"post/2019-05-Improvement-of-ICU-dashboard#Interview\"></a></h2><p>We conducted a semi-structured interview with the staff in ICU. Although our focus was clinical targets, we decided to understand users’ work from a general perspective first, and guide them to talk more about the clinical targets when evaluating the prototype dashboard. The outline of the interview is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction</li>\n<li>Access to data</li>\n<li>Fitting data access into your workflow</li>\n<li>The prototype dashboard</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our interviewees were an anaesthetic registrar and a senior nurse. The former ensures the right level of anaesthesia is administered to patients prior to a surgical procedure, and evaluates patients, ensuring no complications arise post medical or surgical process. The senior nurse provides and assumes most of the direct responsibility for the patient.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Emerging-themes\">Emerging themes<a href=\"post/2019-05-Improvement-of-ICU-dashboard#Emerging-themes\"></a></h1><p>After transcription of interview data, we read through the materials to find emerging themes, and used affinity diagram to group the themes that were similar. At least two members analysed the same part of material in order to triangulate the results. We found nine initial themes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visual affordances</li>\n<li>Privacy / Security</li>\n<li>Frequency / Relevance</li>\n<li>Personalised targets</li>\n<li>Integration into workflow<ul>\n<li>Improve visibility and give me snapshots of my work</li>\n<li>Reliability</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Evidence based metrics that support triggering reviews</li>\n<li>Expected elements on the dashboard<ul>\n<li>Metrics &amp; targets</li>\n<li>Widgets</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Team management<ul>\n<li>Task allocation</li>\n<li>Staff allocation</li>\n<li>Performance &amp; goals</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Location of dashboard</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According the frequency of mentioning and the relevance to our target (clinical target), we chose three themes as the main user needs to further consider.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>How would I integrate it into my workflow?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>“You run around for 12<br>hours, like a headless chicken continuously doing work, going to handover<br>meetings etc and its got to fit into that.”</em></strong> </p>\n<p><strong><em>“I’d expect this to be part<br>of an email chain of an email chain or something to say this happened”</em></strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p>How would I get personalised targets?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>“We want to set different target<br>for each person.”</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>“So looking at this, can you say<br>24 hours is not that useful? Let’s say you move at six months. ”</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p>I need indicators that justify triggering reviews…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>“You need it to be<br>triggering  to go and review a particular<br>patient.”</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>“An alarm which wants you to<br>do something about the problem.”</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"Shaping-user-needs-into-four-stages\">Shaping user needs into four stages<a href=\"post/2019-05-Improvement-of-ICU-dashboard#Shaping-user-needs-into-four-stages\"></a></h1><p>Due to the importance of integrating the dashboard into staff’s daily routine, we discussed and proposed four stages where the information dashboard could function to not only indicate the clinical target, but also improve the ICU performance. The four stages are: <strong>informing, responding, improving, and learning</strong>. The three themes we concluded are touched in more than one stages.</p>\n<p>[illustration here]</p>\n<h2 id=\"Informing\">Informing<a href=\"post/2019-05-Improvement-of-ICU-dashboard#Informing\"></a></h2><p>Objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Increase the visibility of a metrics status.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Provide a deeper insight into what metrics are affecting specific patients. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Provide the ability to switch between different time scales</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My contribution:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Propose using colour coding</li>\n<li>Propose combining icons with ICU floor plan</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Responding\">Responding<a href=\"post/2019-05-Improvement-of-ICU-dashboard#Responding\"></a></h2><p>Objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Providing indicators to justify triggered responses </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Allowing staff to take responsibility if things were to go wrong. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Evidence-based metrics which could be used to support triggered reviews. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My contribution:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Question the meaning of average data</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Improving-and-learning\">Improving and learning<a href=\"post/2019-05-Improvement-of-ICU-dashboard#Improving-and-learning\"></a></h2><p>Objectives:</p>\n<p>-Understanding performance over time </p>\n<p>-Triggering reviews </p>\n<p>-Provide overview for handover </p>\n<p>I think the two stages are quite similar, and they both emphasise the function of dashboard as a tool to help improve the ICU staff’s performance in work.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Reflection\">Reflection<a href=\"post/2019-05-Improvement-of-ICU-dashboard#Reflection\"></a></h1><p>The process of data collection and prototype design is effective and inspiring, while analysing data seems to be a pain. The large amount of data made it difficult for us to analyse with continuous attention, which harmed the credibility of results. It is worth noting that although to prepare an outline of interview seems enough, it is still essential to prepare detailed questions in advance. The detailed questions we prepared for the interview did not take a lot of effect since our talk flowed smoothly, however, the situation would be different if the interviewee is not so active. Therefore, to prepare carefully in advance is necessary.</p>\n<p>The group discussion to generate prototype ideas is interesting, but it might be more effective if we could organise the process better. We could list our critiques of the original prototype and find as much alternatives as possible for each point, rather than choose between only two or three ideas from a general perspective. The careful iteration of limited solutions might make us lose other better choices. </p>\n","prev":{"title":"数字媒体技术是一个怎样的专业","slug":"数字媒体技术是一个怎样的专业"},"next":{"title":"How to make full use of questionnaire","slug":"How-to-make-full-use-of-questionnaire"},"link":"https://sakamotomari.github.io/post/2019-05-Improvement-of-ICU-dashboard/","toc":[{"title":"Project overview","id":"Project-overview","index":"1"},{"title":"Project background","id":"Project-background","index":"2"},{"title":"My proposal","id":"My-proposal","index":"3"},{"title":"Understanding the problems and the users","id":"Understanding-the-problems-and-the-users","index":"4","children":[{"title":"Aim of this project","id":"Aim-of-this-project","index":"4.1"},{"title":"What the current dashboard could do","id":"What-the-current-dashboard-could-do","index":"4.2"},{"title":"Interview","id":"Interview","index":"4.3"}]},{"title":"Emerging themes","id":"Emerging-themes","index":"5"},{"title":"Shaping user needs into four stages","id":"Shaping-user-needs-into-four-stages","index":"6","children":[{"title":"Informing","id":"Informing","index":"6.1"},{"title":"Responding","id":"Responding","index":"6.2"},{"title":"Improving and learning","id":"Improving-and-learning","index":"6.3"}]},{"title":"Reflection","id":"Reflection","index":"7"}]}
