After exploration in three months, our group presented the design solution of an interactive system: Codudo.</p>\n<p>Codudo aims at encouraging international students to express themselves through co-doodling, in order to enhance the sense of belonging. The system is composed of three parts: doodle booth, mobile App and presentation screen. Users will add their own doodle to the digital canvas in the doodle booth; they could interact with other users in the App; the work created collaborately by everyone would be shown in the presentation screen, which is ideally located in a public place in the community.</p>\n<p>How did we narrow the problem from an abstract concept to “senses of belonging”, and how did we come up with the solution of co-doodling? Based on our progress, I will explain it in X parts.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Making-a-persona-from-questionnaire\">Making a persona from questionnaire<a href=\"post/Codudo-a-system-that-improves-senses-of-belonging-through-co-doodling#Making-a-persona-from-questionnaire\"></a></h1>","prev":{"title":"Trying Micro-phenomenology","slug":"Trying-Micro-phenomenology"},"next":{"title":"2018年的故事","slug":"2018年的故事"},"link":"https://sakamotomari.github.io/post/Codudo-a-system-that-improves-senses-of-belonging-through-co-doodling/","toc":[{"title":"Making a persona from questionnaire","id":"Making-a-persona-from-questionnaire","index":"1"}]}
